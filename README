quarantine calisthenic group workouts

a group has a list of weekly goals  
  - the exercises are static but the measurements are customizable  (MVP: static, measurements)

a weekly goal:
  - consists of a measurement and an exercise
  - restarts at the beginning of each week
  - can increase linearly week over week (e.g. +10 pushups WoW) (MVP: unchanging measurements)
  - translates automatically into a series of 7 daily goals

starting set of goals:
  - number of miles ran (MVP: 7)
  - number of pushups (MVP: 70)
  - number of squats (MVP: 140)
  - number of burpees (MVP: 70)
  - number of mountain climbers (MVP: 140)


users can:
  - join multiple groups
  - see their list of daily goals
  - record a 'rep' for a daily goal
  - see the 'reps' for other users in groups the user is in
  - create a group
  - modify the goals of a group the user is in (MVP: no modification)

a rep is:
  - a single measurement of an exercise performed that maps to one of the user's daily/weekly goals
  - summable and dictates whether the user has achieved the daily/weekly goal threshold
  - is valid only for the current day
  - immutable (no deleting or editing)
